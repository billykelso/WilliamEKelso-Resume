							<p>My Portfolio shows my choice to be a communication studies major was easy for me, as I have been writing for local blogs thru high school. I love sports, history and current events. These topics drive my desire to go further in this study. My work experience has given me the benefit of learning to interact with people in a variety of situations. As a waiter at Pine Run Retirement Community, I have gathered a great deal of empathy and people skills that allows me to deal with their issues with maturity and professionalism. I took on a leadership role in the kitchen where I assured that others followed protocols. For this work, I have been rewarded with increases every year and given more responsibility. I balance my work, my class time and my volunteer activities thru my organization skills. As a self-funded student, I strive to assure that I am doing my best at all times. If you choose to give me the opportunity to interview, I am sure you will find that I am a good fit for your organization. Also I have choose to do a minor in General Business Studies to have a wider range of skills I can provided to a business to help in more then one field. I believe learning all of these different skills such as Economics, Accounting, Leadership and Organization Management will improve my skills for communications as well as Marketing and Advertising.</p>
